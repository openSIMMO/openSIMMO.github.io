# Aligning the Setup


1. Collimating the laser
The collimation of the laser is checked with shear plate, place the shear plate in front of the laser lens, slightly move the lens until interference pattern shown on the shear plate with correct rotation

2. Directing the beam onto DMD
Both lasers should shoot roughly in the center of the first mirrors, then the beam is directed to the combine mirror. The red beam passes tightly besides the blue laser mirror, therefore, the red laser beam will be partially blocked by the mirror. Rotate the combine mirror until both laser beam illuminate onto the DMD chip.

3. Heading the beam path parellel to the optical axis

4. Aligning the telescope
Use a laser pointer and place it after the telescope pointint to the DMD
Maybe with the laser pointer start from the BFP make more sense? 1. Collimation can be checked with Tube lens + second telescope lens, 2. The Laser need to focus again on the DMD.

5. Adjusting the tube lens position
After the telescope nicely adjusted, the laser beam should focus in the center of the back focal plane of the objective, placing a cosair target at the objective revolver to check the beam, if is not centered, slightly move the xy translation stage of the tube lens to center the beam. After that, turn the objective back and check the output beam, it should be collimated and direct straightly towards up.

11. Insert the Fourier mask
