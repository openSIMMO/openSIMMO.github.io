# Preparation

For replicating this setup, in general, we need some components need to be prepared in the following categories: 3D printed parts, laser cut enclosure, accessories.


## Optomechanics

In order to keep the system stability, there are some optomechanical components with fine adjust abilities cannot be replaced in the setup. Therefore, we keep some thorlabs parts combining with 3D printed parts, including kinematic mirror mount, 1 inch cage plate, xy translation stage

## 3D Printing Files

The 3D printing files can be found in this folder.
Ray optics mount x7
Kinematic mirror mount x2
Speical mirror mount x1
DMD mount plate x1
DMD assemblies x1



## Lasercutting Files

Ground board with mounting holes x1
Side walls x7

After the side walls are cut with laser cutter, it still need to manually drill some holes sidely for inserting the M3 screws.




## Accessories

In the setup, we also used 3 standard aluminium profile to mount the ray optical parts. The alunimiun profile was required with 2 x 100mm and 1 x 150mm
